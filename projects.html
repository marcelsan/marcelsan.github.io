            <h3>Breast Cancer Analysis</h3>
            <p>We used machine learning algorithms to build a classification model which learns carcinogenic individual's patterns and predicts if a new individual has or no cancer. The analyzed dataset contains about 2000 lines with 6 different features extracted from breast image exams and the target which indicates if the individual was diagnosed with cancer or not. This project was developed in Python using Keras, Pandas and scikit-learn libraries.</p>

            <h3>Indoor Location System Using FingerPrint and Machine Learning</h3>
            <p>
              We compared different algorithms to estimate user's outdoor position using the RSSIs (Received Signal Strength Indicator) collected from different RBS (Radio Base Station) by user's mobile device. The analyzed dataset contains about 2500 lines with 6 different measures from 6 different RBSs. Also, it has 2 columns which represent the user's position (our target).

            <h3>Human Skin Detection Using Bayesian Approaches</h3>
            <p>
              We developed a human skin detection algorithm using Bayesian approaches and a face tracking algorithm. We have prior histograms which store skin and not skin pixels, as the user uses the application we update this histogram by using the mask which gives the skin (positive histogram) and not skin (negative histogram) pixels. This mask is built using the face tracker output and gives us many regions which can be used in order to populate the positive and negative histogram. The developed algorithm is able to detect human skin even with changes in environmental light conditions.

            <h3>Path Tracer</h3>
            <img src="img/path.png" alt="path">
            <p>This project was fully written in C++11 late 2015 to Graphics Computer course at CIn UFPE. It is my first implementation of the Path Tracing global ilumination algorithm. The main features includes: the scene loader (the user can set the camera position, the objects positions and materials, lights etc), the .OBJ loader, anti-aliasing, recursive refraction using Snell's Law, recursive reflection, reflectance and trasmittance following Fresnel's equations. So far, it is only possible use Phong materials. </p>

            <h3>Ray Trace Scene Viewer</h3>
            <p>This project  implements a basic Ray Tracer algorithm. It was fully written in modern C++11 late 2014 to Graphics Processing course at CIn UFPE. The main feature of this viewer is load and process OBJ files applying texture and Phong lighting mode to each one. The user also can change the position of each object and light in scene. Every Ray Tracing computation is parallel (by using std::threads) it makes the rendering process faster. </p>

            <h3>Fluid Engine</h3>
            <p>I have a small contribuition on the open source project <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/doyubkim/fluid-engine-dev">Fluid Engine</a></p>
