            <h3>Path Tracer Denoiser</h3>
            <p>
				 Path tracing can deliver beautiful images. However, it needs thousands of samples per pixel to generate good results. It makes the rendering process take a long time. This delay is prohibitive to real-time applications (such as games) and increases the cost to the movie industry. On the other hand, using low samples per pixel results in a very noisy image. An approach to deal with this tradeoff is rendering a low sampled image and so apply post-processing techniques to get a better result. However, the traditional post-processing techniques are either limited or need a very trick parameters tuning. Thus, the purpose of this project is to build a Convolution Neural Network which delivers a filter able to generate noise-free images from noisy ones.

            <h3>Indoor Location System Using FingerPrint and Machine Learning</h3>
            <p>
              We compared different algorithms to estimate user's outdoor position using the RSSIs (Received Signal Strength Indicator) collected from different RBS (Radio Base Station) by user's mobile device. The analyzed dataset contains about 2500 lines with 6 different measures from 6 different RBSs. Also, it has 2 columns which represent the user's position (our target).

            <h3>Human Skin Detection Using Bayesian Approaches</h3>
            <p>
              We have prior histograms to classify skin and not skin pixels. The histograms were built from a YCbCr images dataset of manually classified pixels. Those offline histograms are stored in a LUT which provides very fast pixel classification using a Bayesian appraoch. As the user utilizes the application we can update histogram by using the face tracker regions. Hence, the algorithm is able to detect human skin even with changes in environmental light conditions. Our algorithm works well in many different conditions and is very fast, capable of running in many different smartphones.

            <h3>Path Tracer</h3>
            <img src="img/path.png" alt="path">
            <p>This project was fully written in C++11 late 2015 to Computer Graphics course. The main features includes: global illumination via unbiased Monte Carlo path tracing, the scene loader (the user can set the camera position, the objects positions and materials, lights etc), the .OBJ loader, anti-aliasing via super-sampling, recursive refraction using Snell's Law, reflectance and transmittance following Fresnel's equations.</p>

            <h3>Ray Trace Scene Viewer</h3>
            <p>This project  implements a basic Ray Tracer algorithm. It was fully written in modern C++11 late 2014 to Graphics Processing course at CIn UFPE. The main feature of this viewer is load and process OBJ files applying texture and Phong lighting mode to each one. The user also can change the position of each object and light in scene. Every Ray Tracing computation is parallel (by using std::threads) it makes the rendering process faster. </p>
